# pks-deploy-meta

This is a meta repository to assemble all repositories required for a PKS + NSX-T deployment on vSphere.

Do not clone this repository. Instead, [install Git Repo](https://source.android.com/source/downloading#installing-repo).

Once you've installed Git Repo, you will use it to download and assemble all the component git repositories.

This processis as follows:
* create and/or change into a directory where you'd like to place all source relevant to this PKS deployment
* then execute the following

`repo init -u git@gitlab.eng.vmware.com:ps-emerging/pks-deploy-meta.git`

...followed by...

`repo sync`
